# FSEGA_schedule
Automatic FSEGA classes scheduler. Don't want to click so much to get to your classes? Use this

## How it works
The app is at the moment only a terminal based application, the plan is to change it to something more apealling while keeping it simple.

At the first opening it asks you for your group, the language you study and the semigroup you are in(after the first run it will never ask you these quiestions again,
it will store your data in a config.json file and at the moment you can only change them by opening this file and manually overwriting them.

The app is not that smart so whenever it is needed you have to provide the type of the week(odd or even)

## How to install it
You will download this zip file:
Linux:
Windows:[fsega_schedule_windows_x64](https://github.com/CrutoiAlexandru/FSEGA_schedule/releases/download/v0.1.0/fsega_schedule_windows_x64.exe)

After you can make a shortcut to the executable and put it wherever you want(atm you have to do it alone).

## How the code works
The schedule's code is very basic and at the moment it lacks in comments(like it has 0).
It was a quick one and done, but it still doesn't excuse the way it was coded.

The code is very raw, it uses perdeterminated dictionaries and alot of conditions in order to work.
The dictionaries and conditions are based on a schedule given by FSEGA.

I will probably change it in the future and make mor readable.
