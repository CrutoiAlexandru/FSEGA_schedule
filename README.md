# FSEGA_schedule
Automatic FSEGA classes scheduler. Don't want to click so much to get to your classes? Use this

## How it works
At the first opening it asks you for your group, the language you study, the semigroup you are in and the optional class you are taking. After the first run it will never ask you these questions again, but you can at all times change them from the gui option about student info.

The app is not that smart so whenever it is needed you have to provide the type of the week(odd or even). A pop up window will appear asking if the current week is even, if the answer is no it will assume otherwise. 

If you find any bugs or mistakes please report them to me, the app still needs to be tested more.

## How to install it
You will download the zip file your system needs:
Linux:[fsega_schedule_linux_x64](https://github.com/CrutoiAlexandru/FSEGA_schedule/releases/download/v1.0.0/fsega_schedule_linux_x64.zip)
Windows:[fsega_schedule_windows_x64](https://github.com/CrutoiAlexandru/FSEGA_schedule/releases/download/v1.0.0/fsega_schedule_windows_x64.zip)

After you can make a shortcut to the executable and put it wherever you want(atm you have to do it alone). The executable file is found in the main folder called FsegaSchedule.

## How the code works
The schedule's code is very basic and at the moment it lacks in comments(like it has 0).
It was a quick one and done, but it still doesn't excuse the way it was coded.

The code is very raw, it uses perdeterminated dictionaries and alot of conditions in order to work.
The dictionaries and conditions are based on a schedule given by FSEGA.

I will probably change it in the future and make more readable.
